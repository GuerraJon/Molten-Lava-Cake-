Step 1: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.
Step 2: In a double boiler, over simmering water, add the chocolate, then add the butter, melt the butter with the chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, add the 1/4 cup of sugar and  the pinch of salt at high speed until thickened and pale.
Step 3: Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along with the 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft. 
Step 4: Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.

Notes: 
The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room temperature before baking.

Molten chocolate cakes are easily one of the ultimate Valentine's Day desserts.

While these cakes easily stand alone, they're over-the-top when served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
